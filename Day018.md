## 1)For given integer n ≤ 9 print a ladder of n steps. The k-th step consists of the integers from 1 to k without spaces between them.

To do that, you can use the sep and end arguments for the function print().
```
Example input
3

Example output
1
12
123
```
# CODE

a = int(input())

for i in range(1,a+1):
  
  for j in range(1,i+1):
    
    print(j)
    
    
## 2)There was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost. Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.

Given a number N, followed by N − 1 integers representing the numbers on the remaining cards (distinct integers in the range from 1 to N). Find and print the number on the lost card.

Example input

#CODE

a = int(input())

list=[]

for i in range(a-1):
  
  list.append(int(input()))

for x in range(1,a+1):
  
  if x not in list:
    
    print(x)
    
    
 ## 3)The Indian Air Force (IAF)  is using more than 10,000 spy planes to  
go across LoC to scout for terrorist camps in Pakistan. Whenever a spy   
plane takes off for reconnaissance, the Plane ID is added to a list.  
Whenever the plane returns, the ID is again added to the same list.   

One spy plane alone has gone missing, so its ID was not added to the  
list a second time.  By the way, IDs are not guaranteed to be  
sorted or sequential.   

1. Given a list of plane IDs, write a program to print out the ID of 
the missing spy plane. 
2. If no plane is found missing, then print "All arrived!"

    for y in range(len(plane_id)):
      
      if plane_id[x] == plane_id[y]:
        
        count+=1

else:
  
  print("All arrived!")
