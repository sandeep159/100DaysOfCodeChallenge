## 1)Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

```
Example input
3900

Example output
1 65

```
# CODE

#Read an integer:

number_of_seconds = int(input())

#Print a value:

number_of_minutes=(number_of_seconds//60)

number_of_hours=(number_of_minutes//60)

print(number_of_hours,number_of_minutes)

## 2)Given two timestamps of the same day: a number of hours, minutes and seconds for both of the timestamps. The moment of the first timestamp happened before the moment of the second one. Calculate how many seconds passed between them.

```
Example input #1
1
1
1
2
2
2

Example output #1
3661
```
# CODE

#Read an integer:

hour1 = int(input())

minute1 = int(input())

second1 = int(input())

hour2 = int(input())

minute2 = int(input())

second2 = int(input())

#Print a value:

total_second1=(hour1*60*60)+(minute1*60)+second1

total_second2=(hour2*60*60)+(minute2*60)+second2

SecondPassed=total_second2-total_second1

print(SecondPassed)
