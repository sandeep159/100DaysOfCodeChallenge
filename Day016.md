## Try and limit the number of conditional statements to not more than two. 
This requires some advanced Python language knowledge. I don't expect everyone  
to be able to complete this.

Write a program that receives a number on the input and prints values from 1 to that number subjected to the conditions below. 
It also should receive another value 'rev' (either 0 or 1) on the input. 

For every number in the given range,   
- If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs".   
- If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".  
- If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".        
  - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"  
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".        
  - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
 - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
       - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.

REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing.    
  - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7   
  - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7   
  - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5    
  - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
  
  ```
  INPUT

False
OUTPUT
1

Mugs
  ```
  # CODE
  
  n = int(input())
rev =bool(input())
result=""
a=["Jugs","Mugs","Pugs"]
b=[3,5,7]
c=["Pugs","Mugs","Jugs"]
d=[7,5,3]
for i in range(1,n+1):
  temp=str(i)
  result=""
  for j in range(3):
    if rev==True and str(d[j]) in str(i) or i%d[j]== 0:
      result+=c[j]
      temp=""
      continue
    if rev==False and str(b[j]) in str(i) and i%b[j]== 0:
      result+=a[j]
      temp=""
  print(temp+result)
